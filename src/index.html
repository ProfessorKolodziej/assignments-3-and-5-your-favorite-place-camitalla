	<h1>Mount Auburn Cemetery</h1>
	<p>The Mount Auburn Cemetery, dedicated in 1831, is the first garden cemetery in the United States. Located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it is a stark contrast to the overcrowded and unhygienic burial plots that were so prevalent in New England during the formative years of the United States. With the help of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, physician Jacob Bigelow proposed the Mount Auburn Cemetery in 1825 to address this problem and create a peaceful and quiet repose where the living could enjoy the space while they pay respects to the dead.</p>
	<p>Every aspect of the cemetery was carefully thought out in order to provide the most picturesque, tranquil atmosphere. The winding paths and extensive horticulture make walking through the Mount Auburn a very calming experience, drawing you into the landscape and inviting you to learn more about the people buried there. It is also rich with history, giving unique insights into the art, politics, and everyday life of the Victorian Era. Many graves are adorned with intricate statues that themselves could be considered art. Its legacy as the nation’s first garden cemetery has set a precedent for future burial grounds, setting the stage for a future where the emphasis is placed on the importance of beauty, dignity, and respect in memorializing the dead.</p>
